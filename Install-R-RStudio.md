## To install R:
1.	Go to the [R-Project website](https://www.r-project.org/)
2.	On the left, click the “CRAN” link below “Download”
3.	Click on the link to the CRAN mirror closest to you (e.g. Oregon State if you’re in CA)
4.	Choose the correct “Download R for…” option from the top (Mac or Windows)
    * For Mac users, select the appropriate version for your operating system (e.g. if the latest release is version 3.6.3, click the appropriate .pkg link that includes R-3.6.3), then choose to Save or Open
    *	For PC users, choose “Install R for the first time” (next to the base subdirectory) and then “Download R 3.6.3 for Windows” at the top of the page
5.	Save the pkg or exe file, open it once it downloads, agree to the license, and install like you would any other program

## To install RStudio (AFTER you have installed R):
1.	Go to the RStudio [download page](https://www.rstudio.com/products/rstudio/download/) to download RStudio **Desktop** (Open Source License). 
2.	Click download, which scrolls down to the **All Installers** table. Click the link in the Download column that matches your operating system.
3.	Save the file, open once it downloads, agree to the license, and install like you would any other program

## Open R Studio to check that everything is working correctly
Make sure you’re running RStudio (logo is white R inside of a blue circle) rather than R directly (blue R in front of a gray oval); RStudio will run R behind the scenes. There should be multiple panes visible (the Console pane, a pane with tabs labled Environment, History, and Connections (upper right), and a pane with tabs labled Files, Plots, Packages, Help, and Viewer (lower right). 

You can run code directly in the console, or you can run code from scripts (text files that you can save so you can reproduce your work later). To make a new script in R, click on the white square with a green plus sign (upper left hand corner) and click R Script. To load a script saved on your computer, click the Folder icon in the toolbar at the top of the window or click File -> Open File. Navigate to the script location and click Open. 

Download this [sample script] (from box) to a folder on your computer and open it using the process above for a very basic introduction to R commands. Alternatively, copy and paste the text from [this script on github](https://github.com/ldnagel/spatial-r-for-gis-users/blob/a3e0ecea3a0826a1ecf3d3fe69cfef55b9d56f95/scripts/r-basics-code.R) to a new R script. Save that R script (click the blue floppy disk icon) to a folder on your computer before running through the code.
