## Pre-Workshop Setup

### Make sure that you have up-to-date versions of R (â‰¥ 3.3.0) and RStudio

  * For instructions on how to install R and RStudio for the first time, go [here](https://github.com/ldnagel/spatial-r-for-gis-users/blob/master/getting_started/Install-R-RStudio.md)
  * For tips on how to update your R version and migrate your packages without having to re-install them all manually:
    * On Windows: [this blog post](https://www.r-bloggers.com/a-step-by-step-screenshots-tutorial-for-upgrading-r-on-windows/) runs through how to use a package that automates the process
    * On a Mac: [this package](https://github.com/AndreaCirilloAC/updateR) automates the process (scroll down to the Readme section for code you can copy/paste to install and run the package)
    * For any system: [this blog post](https://www.datascienceriot.com//r/upgrade-R-packages/) goes through a manual workflow that [this post](https://www.r-bloggers.com/updating-r/) expands on (extra details on what to do if you have a lot of packages that aren't on CRAN)
    

### Check your package versions

* There have been some recent major overhauls of core spatial packages and some of the packages they depend on. 
* [Here's a list of the package versions used in this workshop](https://github.com/ldnagel/spatial-r-for-gis-users/blob/master/getting_started/r-packages.md) and some package installation tips
  * We highly recommend installing these versions ahead of time (unfortunately, the virtual format of this workshop sharply limits the amount of one-on-one code troubleshooting we can do)

### Slow Internet?

* Download the data ahead of time on [GitHub](https://github.com/ldnagel/spatial-r-for-gis-users/tree/master/data) or from [Box](https://ucdavis.box.com/s/gvw5r4jlh5nu21ie4zp5htn8ga5pn53o). Unzip the folder and put the data in a single folder called "data"

### New to R? 

* Make sure you check out the RStudio Basics section of the [installing R and RStudio](https://github.com/ldnagel/spatial-r-for-gis-users/blob/master/getting_started/Install-R-RStudio.md) section and run through [this code](https://github.com/ldnagel/spatial-r-for-gis-users/blob/master/scripts/r-basics-code.R) in RStudio ahead of time
  
### Need troubleshooting help? 
 
 * If you're affiliated with UC Davis and are having trouble installing the software or R packages, or if you have any questions about R or GIS, [DataLab](https://datalab.ucdavis.edu/office-hours/) offers (virtual) drop-in hours Mondays 1:30-3pm PST
