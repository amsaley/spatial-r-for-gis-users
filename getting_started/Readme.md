## Pre-Workshop Setup

### Make sure that you have up-to-date versions of R (â‰¥ 3.3.0) and RStudio

  * For instructions on how to install R and RStudio for the first time, go [here](https://github.com/ldnagel/spatial-r-for-gis-users/blob/master/getting_started/Install-R-RStudio.md).
  * For instructions on how to update your R version and migrate your packages:

### Check your package versions

* There have been some recent major overhauls of core spatial packages and some of the packages they depend on. 
* [Here's a list of the package versions used in this workshop](https://github.com/ldnagel/spatial-r-for-gis-users/blob/master/getting_started/r-packages.md) and some package installation tips
  * We highly recommend installing these versions ahead of time (unfortunately, the virtual format of this workshop sharply limits the amount of one-on-one code troubleshooting we can do)
  
 ### Need troubleshooting help? 
 
 * If you're affiliated with UC Davis and are having trouble installing the software or R packages, [DataLab](https://datalab.ucdavis.edu/office-hours/) offers (virtual) drop-in hours Mondays 1:30-3pm PST.
